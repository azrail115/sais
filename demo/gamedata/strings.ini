STARTGAME_MUCRON1 In the 22nd century, colony ships were programmed to search for earthlike planets along trajectories calculated to visit stars with the best likelihood of habitable worlds. One such ship with its crew and passengers in deep cryosleep traveled over 2300 light years before a suitable planet was found.
STARTGAME_MUCRON2 Hope is a temperate world located in the Glory system on the edge of a vast nebula some refer to as the Purple Void. The nebula is unique in that it contains many unusual star types and other interesting phenomena.
STARTGAME_MUCRON3 Over 100 years have passed since the colonists first arrived. It is a new beginning of deep space exploration. Technology has improved and mankind is no longer dependent on slow cryoships and robot probes. This is the setting of Strange Adventures In Infinite Space.
STARTGAME_MUCRON7 Far above the dark side of the Tiberian moon you engage your starship's chemical thrusters and prepare to leave the Glory system. Thus begins your strange adventure in Infinite Space.

ENDGAME_DEATH5 The %s has been blown to bits by a fusion bomb planted by a ruthless saboteur. As the seething sphere of burning debris expands outward from the blast your strange adventure in Infinite Space concludes in an untimely way.
ENDGAME_DEATH6 The Glory system, including the colony homeworld of Hope, the Tiberian moon and all human inhabitants, has been harvested by the dread Yellow Kawangi. Nothing remains but countless tons of cosmic debris orbiting a dim neutron star. Mankind's strange adventure in Infinite Space has come to an untimely and unfortunate conclusion.
ENDGAME_DEATH7 The Glory system, including the colony homeworld of Hope, the Tiberian moon and all human inhabitants, has been annihilated by a vacuum collapser device. Nothing remains. A void of deep space now extends five light years in every direction. The %s has no homeworld to return to. Your strange adventure in Infinite Space has come to a horrifying and unthinkable conclusion.
