![sais build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ptitSeb/sais.png "sais build status")

Strange Adventure in Infinite Space for Linux and Pandora.

This version is based on the official sources released by digital-eel, but slightly changed to build under Linux. The Windows version should still compile

You'l need cmake (v2.8 minimum), SDL and SDL_mixer.

It has been tested on OpenPandora. The Mods have been quickly tested and seems to work.

To get data, go to official site of sais http://digital-eel.com/sais/ and download the full release, it's free (grab the osx version and extract the dmg data using 7z on linux, or install the Windows on Wine).
